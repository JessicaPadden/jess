        <dt> HTTP</dt>
        <dd>is an application-level protocol for fetching resources
such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a
client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web
browser </dd>

<dt>HTTPS </dt>
<dd> is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[1][2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3] or HTTP over SSL. </dd>
